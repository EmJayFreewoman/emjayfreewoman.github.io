### Projects
- Community has been a critical aspect of my open source career. I've worked with a variety of technologists, including IT architects, engineers, and developers; it only makes sense to dive a deeper into DevOps as it underpins the SDLC. Combining my love of community and wanting to become a bit more hands on with software development, I am exploring basic frontend development through freecodecamp.org. Here is a [Collaboration Survey](https://github.com/EmJayFreewoman/collaborationsurvey) I built to learn a bit more about how teams collaborate across organizations.
- On a personal note - I am a self-taught graphic designer! Here's a glimpse into my work: [My first attempt using Procreate Animatie](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yrKJHeVIO1QGC3ozxRXFcqGYHregEkC0/view?usp=sharing)
