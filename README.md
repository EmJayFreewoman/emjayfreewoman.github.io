#### *RFP Support Specialist @Lenovo* (April 2019 - Aug. 2020)
- Before COVID-19 took the world by storm, I was asked to build a series of Work-From-Home (WFH) flyers as part of the Lenovo Customer Relief Program campaign, from copy to design. I had no professional copywriting experience at the time. Here are a few:
1. [HiEd Customers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3zT3tEdMYvSbSJXJzq0fuJfk9NV79l4/edit)

### Personal Projects
- Community has been a critical aspect of my open source career. I've worked with a variety of technologists, including IT architects, engineers, and developers; it only makes sense to dive deeper into DevOps, as it underpins the SDLC. Combining my love of community and wanting to become a bit more hands on with software development, I am learning basic frontend development through freecodecamp.org. Here is a [Collaboration Survey](https://github.com/EmJayFreewoman/collaborationsurvey) I built to learn a bit more about how teams collaborate across organizations.
- On a personal note - I am a self-taught graphic designer! Here's a NSFW gif I created just for kicks [My first attempt using Procreate Animate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yrKJHeVIO1QGC3ozxRXFcqGYHregEkC0/view?usp=sharing)
